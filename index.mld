prbnmcn-cgrph is a basic library to describe and run incremental computations.

This library is pretty young: use at your own perils. If you are looking for a
 more mature library, have a look at {{: https://github.com/janestreet/incremental} Incremental}, {{: https://github.com/ocurrent/current_incr} current_incr}
or perhaps {{: https://github.com/let-def/lwd} lwd}.

See the {{!Cgraph.introduction}introduction} for some usage example.
